# PRODIGY_DS_01
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring country-wise population trends from 1960 to 2023. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and visualized using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

🔧 Tools Used:
* Python
* Pandas
* Seaborn & Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

✅ What I Did:
* Cleaned and reshaped the dataset using pandas.melt()
* Filtered data for specific countries and years
* Created bar plots (e.g., India’s growth)
* Created histograms to show 2023 population distribution

🧠 Skills Gained:
* Data wrangling
* Data visualization
* Debugging and plot formatting
  
📌 Challenges:
* Reshaping wide data
* Handling missing values and data types
* Avoiding overlapping labels in plots
